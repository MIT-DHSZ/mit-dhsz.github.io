## Files tab
This section can be used both as content repository and as a space for students to work in (individually or collaboratively).
The “Class Materials” default folder is a ‘read-only’ folder. This can be used for teachers to upload resources students
may need but should not change or remove. Students have no permission to add files to this folder.
##   Adding folders
Teachers (or students) may choose to add other folders under the Files tab. This can be done by pressing ‘New’ Followed by ‘Folder’ (see screenshot below
In addition, teacher can create Word/Excel/PPT files which will automatically be set up with edit rights for students. This is a great way to set up group/class work and encourage students to collaborate.
## Assignment tab
This can be used to set individual assignments for students. Assignments can be set to ‘go live’ at a designated time, to better facilitate online, live learning. Teacher can attach resources, rubrics and differentiate work by assigning different tasks to different students.

To set the time when the assignment will be available for students, press the ‘Edit’ button at the bottom, tick the 
















‘schedule to assign in the future’ box and change the date and time.



Rubrics are extremely useful not only for self-assessment but also for feedback. Once set up, teacher can give specific feedback based on the rubric set up. This makes the feedback clear and relevant for the students. Please note that both descriptors (criteria) and a achievement levels can be modified/added/removed to cater to teacher’s needs.


Please discuss with your HOYs to hear suggestions on add-ons relevant to your subject areas. Flipgrid (video reflection/feedback tool) is just one of many useful add-ons.

Once added, it will appear as one of the tabs in your Team.

Note: For Flipgrid, you will first need to create the grid (once), using your Microsoft log-in.


## Side bar
‘Assignments’ tab on the side bar can be used to see a summary of all the assignment set by a teacher as well as the status (who submitted/didn’t).
‘Chat’ tab can be used, as name suggests, to communicate with students/teachers.
